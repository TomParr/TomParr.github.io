	<p>I have spent the last 5 years working and studying with The Open University culminating with my graduating with a BSc (Hons) Computing and IT with a 2.2.<br />

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<h3>Tesco Pembury</h3>
<p>I have worked in my current position for several years now, the hours suited my studies. During my time here I have managed to continue to learn and push myself to new challenges. <br />
I have applied for and taken jobs throughout the store format, helping to boost my knowledge of the technical aspects within the business, from the backstock database to the PDA system.
</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
	Over the last few years I have spent a lot of time learning different programming languages such as HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, PHP, Java and Python. I found my time playing with a Raspberry Pi exceptionally useful for Python, as well as CMI commands and working with different OS’s as well. 
I have run and played for a six aside football team for several years, which I feel has helped my organisational skills as well as people and time management. 
I enjoy running and have completed a marathon for charity, as well as maintaining a routine of several runs a week. 
I have also completed several long-distance walks with my partner and our dog.

In 2012 I took 6 months out of work to go travelling in New Zealand – providing unpaid work in exchange for food and accommodation. This provided me with the opportunity to experience several different job roles and work as a team as well as independently.
