	<h1>Tom Parr</h2>
	<p>I have spent the last 5 years working and studying with The Open University culminating with my graduating with a BSc (Hons) Computing and IT with a 2.2.
	Whilst my vocational background has been a primarily customer facing environment, performing time critical tasks as a team and individually.
	I have spent a lot of my spare time making projects using the languages I've learned during my studies - check out my <a href="/blog">Blog</a>.
	I've built up a list of skills during my studies and work life including:
	Coding Skills:
