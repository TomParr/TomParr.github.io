<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<h3> Calero-MDSL Application Support Specialist</h3>
	<p>This is a first/second line support role for several different software that Calero-MDSL provides. Primarily I have supported 'Vision' and 'MDM', both similar
	versions of the software that provide telecom expense management and Money Data Management spend management respectively. <br />
	The role consists of both front end and backend troubleshooting, with SQL being the primary language used. 
	This role has helped me to cement my knowledge of SQL as well as to build up some complex queries. As part of this role I have also helped to train new starters
	how to support and use the software.
	</p>
<h3>Calero-MDSL Template creating Mar 2020 - Jul 2020</h3>
	<p>My first role within Calero-MDSL was <a href = "/blog/2020/06/13/Using-code-for-text-recognition"> using
	a combination of VB-Scrpit and regular expressions</a> I used a custom program to automatically extract information from invoices.<br />
	This role was orignally a 3 month contract position, however due to my work ethic I was asked to stay on an additional month to assist with other tasks.
	Due to Covid, this was a work from home job for 3 months, which allowed me to utilise my focus and dedication to work that I cultivated and built during my 
	Open University studies.<br />
	It was partially due to my work ethic and attitude that I was offered my next role within Calero-MDSL, with the manager hiring being particually
	impressed with my ability to work from home, proven both with my degree and with this role.
	</p>
		

<h3>Tesco Pembury 2009 - 2020</h3>
	<p>During my time here I have managed to continue to learn and push myself to new challenges. <br />
	I have applied for and taken jobs throughout the store format, helping to boost my knowledge of the technical aspects within the business, from the backstock database to the PDA system.<br />
	This role helped support my studies.
	</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<p>
	Over the last few years I have spent a lot of time learning different programming languages such as HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, PHP, Java and Python.
	I found my time playing with a Raspberry Pi exceptionally useful for Python, as well as Command Line Arguments and working with different Operating Systems as well. 
	<br />
	I have run and played for a six aside football team for several years, which I feel has helped my organisational skills as well as people and time management. 
	I enjoy running and have completed a marathon for charity, as well as maintaining a routine of several runs a week. 
	I have also completed several long-distance walks with my partner and our dog.
	I have a motorbike and enjoy the maintaining and servicing it completely (and occasionally riding it), as well as doing minor tasks on my car.
	I find this very therapeutic and the logical aspect appeals to me in a way similar to what draws me to web development!
	<br />
	In 2012 I took 6 months out of work to go travelling in New Zealand â€“ providing unpaid work in exchange for food and accommodation.
 	This provided me with the opportunity to experience several different job roles and work in a team as well as independently.
