<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<h3>Tesco Pembury</h3>
<p>I have worked in my current position for several years now, the hours suited my studies. During my time here I have managed to continue to learn and push myself to new challenges. <br />
I have applied for and taken jobs throughout the store format, helping to boost my knowledge of the technical aspects within the business, from the backstock database to the PDA system.
</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
Over the last few years I have spent a lot of time learning different programming languages such as HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript, PHP, Java and Python.
I found my time playing with a Raspberry Pi exceptionally useful for Python, as well as Command Line Arguments and working with different Operating Systems as well. 
<br />
I have run and played for a six aside football team for several years, which I feel has helped my organisational skills as well as people and time management. 
I enjoy running and have completed a marathon for charity, as well as maintaining a routine of several runs a week. 
I have also completed several long-distance walks with my partner and our dog.
I have a motorbike and enjoy the maintaining and servicing it completely (and occasionally riding it), as well as doing minor tasks on my car.
I find this very therapeutic and the logical aspect appeals to me in a way similar to what draws me to web development!
<br />
In 2012 I took 6 months out of work to go travelling in New Zealand â€“ providing unpaid work in exchange for food and accommodation.
 This provided me with the opportunity to experience several different job roles and work in a team as well as independently.
