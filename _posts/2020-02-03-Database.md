title: "Creating a Database"
date: 2020-02-01

For my final University project, I chose to design and create a database to be used by small businesses, to help them adhere to GDPR 
(General Data Protection Regulations). I spent a long time deciding which software to use, 
 partially to ensure it was user friendly and able to be secured to the GDPR standards. and partially because I'd never done it before so had to learn it!<br />
 I settled on using a [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) environment because this was simple enough for me to set up and also quite simple to 
 build a small website to enable users to save data to the system. <br />
 <pre> <code>
 <body>
<!-- script to link to javascript in a different page-->
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://tm470/www/data/externalJavaScript.js"></script>


<hr/>
<h1>Submit a new client</h1>
<hr/>
<p>We are saving your data to ensure we are able to contact you in the future, this </br>
	will only be used by our company and not be used for marketing purposes. </p> 
<form action="http://tm470/www/data/storedata.php"
      method="post" name="submitClientForm" onsubmit="return checkForm()">
<table>
<tr><td>Please ensure you've read the above statement to the client</td>
	<td><input type="checkbox" name="dataSaved" required/></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Name</td>
<td><input type="text" name="ClientName" size="20" maxlength="20" required/></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Address</td>
<td><input type="text" name="Address" style="width:200px; height:100px;" required/></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Email</td>
</code></pre>
A bit of the code I used to make the form, showing a link to an external JavaScript page to utilize some regular expressions, this helps
 ensure the user has saved the clients details correctly.
 It also shows a checkbox that must be ticked, to ensure the user has read a statement to the client.
