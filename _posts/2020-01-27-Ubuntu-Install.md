title: "Installing Ubuntu onto an old laptop"

A mini project I completed recently was to install a linux based operating system on an old laptop.
After a bit of research, I decided to use <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. <br />
My main incentive for doing the project was to help utilize Jekyll's ability to allow me to post to my website from the command line
 and not have to access the github website and create a new file every time. I selected Ubuntu because it maintains a recognisable 
 user interface quite similar to a windows desktop. <br />
 Once I'd picked an operating system, the actual install was quite simple. I followed the official <a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop#0">instructions</a> on Ubuntus website.
 Using my main PC I downloaded the build onto a USB pen which I connected to my laptop (after ensuring it didn't have any useful data on it!)
 I rebooted the laptop and using the BIOS I booted from the USB pen and followed the instructions to create the OS. <br />
 This will prove quite useful in the long term, beyond breathing new life into an old laptop that was running unsupported Windows Vistam
 because Ubuntu is very similar to the OS I use in my Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) - both use Linux and the command line inputs are as far as I can tell identical!<br />
  One thing I have found, due to the physical layout of my workspace, it is quicker and more easy for me to just open the github webpage to update a blog post!
