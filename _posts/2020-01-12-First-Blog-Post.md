This is the first of many blog posts I'll be writing, I've used this website - http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ to help create
what I hope will be a good looking website! I've used my own layout ideas and tweaked what was used in the tutorial to make it more personal to me.

Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
