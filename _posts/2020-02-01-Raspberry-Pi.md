Last Christmas I got a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a 
[Freenove kit (from Amazon).](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Freenove-Electronics-Programming-Solderless-Breadboard/dp/B06W54L7B5?ref_=ast_sto_dp)
A fantastic bit of kit that has about 20 projects that utilize the provided breadboard and components with the provided code (It offers the ability to write the code yourself) 
to build things like an LED bargraph. <br />
It took me a few months to go through all the projects, and I'm sure I'll make use of at least some of the components in a later build,
 when I finally decide what to use it for long term! <br />
 I have also used the [Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to find other projects I had fun building, that were more focused on just using 
  the Pi, more code based. I also looked at using the [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) website to create an emulation console. <br />
  This helped me understand that the OS is stored on an SD card and it is really easy to swap between different Operating Systems! However I soon 
  found the legal issues surrounding ROMS and emulation in general were too complex for me to use the RetroPie with a clear conscience!
