	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p> I'm a 30 year old hopeful developer. I live in Chatham with my girlfriend and our baby! <br />
		I split my spare time between spending time with baby and doing as much web develpment stuff I can!
		I've spent several hours experimenting with my Raspberry Pi, the next plan is to try to combine it with another hobby - aquariums! The eventual plan is to create a monitoring system, perhaps using <a href https://reef-pi.github.io/>Reef-Pi</a>.
		I play 6 aside football once a week and during the summer I like to use my motorbike as much as possible for work commuiting, although I tend to spend more time washing it than actually riding it!</p>
