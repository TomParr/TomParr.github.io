	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> I'm a 30 year old hopeful developer. I live in Chatham with my girlfriend and our baby! < /br>
		I split my spare time between spending time with baby and doing as much web develpment stuff I can!
		I've spent several hours experimenting with my Raspberry Pi, the next plan is to try to combine it with another hobby - aquariums!
		During the summer I like to use my motorbike as much as possible for work commuiting, although I tend to spend more time washing it than actually riding it!</p>
